      "108: “Do we look silly?”\n",
      "109: “You talk silly,” A1 said to him.\n",
      "110: “What the hell do you argue with this kid for? Listen,” he said to George, “tell the nigger to come out here.”\n",
      "111: “What are you going to do to him?”\n",
      "112: “Nothing. Use your head, bright boy.\n",

      "176: “You talk too damn much,” Al said.\n",
      "177: “The nigger and my bright boy are amused by themselves.\n",
      "178: I got them tied up like a couple of girl friends in the convent.”\n",
      "179: “I suppose you were in a convent.”\n",
      "180: “You never know.”\n",
      "181: “You were in a kosher convent.\n",
      "182: That’s where you were.”\n",

      "184: “If anybody comes in you tell them the cook is off, and if they keep after it, you tell them you’ll go\n",
      "185: back and cook yourself.\n",
      "186: Do you get that, bright boy?”\n",
      "187: “All right,” George said.\n",
      "188: “What you going to do with us afterward?”\n",

      "198: “He’ll be back in about half an hour.”\n",
      "199: “I’d better go up the street,” the motorman said.\n",
      "200: George looked at the clock.\n",
      "201: It was twenty minutes, past six.\n",
      "202: “That was nice, bright boy,” Max said.\n",
      "203: “You’re a regular little gentleman.”\n",
      "204: “He knew I’d blow his head off,” Al said from the kitchen.\n",
      "205: “No,” said Max.\n",
      "206: “It ain’t that.\n",
      "207: Bright boy is nice.\n",
      "208: He’s a nice boy.\n",
      "209: I like him.”\n",
      "210: At six-fifty-five George said: “He’s not coming.”\n",
      "211: Two other people had been in the lunchroom.\n",
      "212: Once George had gone out to the kitchen and made a ham-and-egg sandwich “to go” that a man wanted to take with him.\n",
      "213: Inside the kitchen he saw Al, his derby hat tipped back, sitting on a stool beside the wicket with the muzzle of a sawed-off shotgun resting on the ledge.\n",
      "214: Nick and the cook were back to back in the corner, a towel tied in each of their mouths.\n",
      "215: George had cooked the sandwich, wrapped it up in oiled paper, put it in a bag, brought it in, and the man had paid for it and gone out.\n",
      "216: “Bright boy can do everything,” Max said.\n",
      "217: “He can cook and everything. You’d make some girl a nice wife, bright boy.”\n",
      "218: “Yes?” George said, “Your friend, Ole Anderson, isn’t going to come.”\n",
      "219: “We’ll give him ten minutes,” Max said.\n",
      "220: Max watched the mirror and the clock.\n",
      "221: The hands of the clock marked seven o’clock, and then five minutes past seven.\n",
      "222: “Come on, Al,” said Max.\n",
      "223: “We better go. He’s not coming.”\n",
      "224: “Better give him five minutes,” Al said from the kitchen.\n",
      "225: In the five minutes a man came in, and George explained that the cook was sick.\n",
      "226: “Why the hell don’t you get another cook?” the man asked.\n",
      "227: “Aren’t you running a lunch-counter?”\n",
      "228: He went out.\n",
      "229: “Come on, Al,” Max said.\n",
      "230: “What about the two bright boys and the nigger?”\n",
      "231: “They’re all right.”\n",
      "232: “You think so?”\n",
      "233: “Sure. We’re through with it.”\n",
      "234: “I don’t like it,” said Al.\n",
      "235: “It’s sloppy.\n",
      "236: You talk too much.”\n",
      "237: “Oh, what the hell,” said Max.\n",
      "238: “We got to keep amused, haven’t we?”\n",
      "239: “You talk too much, all the same,” Al said.\n",
      "240: He came out from the kitchen.\n",
      "241: The cut-off barrels of the shotgun made a slight bulge under the waist of his too tight-fitting overcoat.\n",
      "242: He straightened his coat with his gloved hands.\n",
      "243: “So long, bright boy,” he said to George.\n",
      "244: “You got a lot of luck.”\n",
      "245: “That’s the truth,” Max said.\n",
      "246: “You ought to play the races, bright boy.”\n",
      "247: The two of them went out the door.\n",
      "248: George watched them, through the window, pass under the arc-light and across the street.\n",
      "249: In their tight overcoats and derby hats they looked like a vaudeville team.\n",
      "250: George went back through the swinging door into the kitchen and untied Nick and the cook.\n",
      "251: “I don’t want any more of that,” said Sam, the cook. “I don’t want any more of that.”\n",
      "252: Nick stood up.\n",
      "253: He had never had a towel in his mouth before.\n",
      "254: “Say,” he said.\n",
      "255: “What the hell?”\n",
      "256: He was trying to swagger it off.\n",
      "257: “They were going to kill Ole Anderson,” George said.\n",
      "258: “They were going to shoot him when he came in to eat.”\n",
      "259: “Ole Anderson?”\n",
      "260: “Sure.”\n",
      "261: The cook felt the corners of his mouth with his thumbs.\n",
      "262: “They all gone?” he asked.\n",
      "263: “Yeah,” said George.\n",
      "264: “They’re gone now.”\n",
      "265: “I don’t like it,” said the cook.\n",
      "266: “I don’t like any of it at all”\n",
      "267: “Listen,” George said to Nick.\n",
      "268: “You better go see Ole Anderson.”\n",
      "269: “All right.”\n",
      "270: “You better not have anything to do with it at all,” Sam, the cook, said.\n",
      "271: “You better stay way out of it.”\n",
      "272: “Don’t go if you don’t want to,” George said.\n",
      "273: “Mixing up in this ain’t going to get you anywhere,” the cook said.\n",
      "274: “You stay out of it.”\n",
      "275: “I’ll go see him,” Nick said to George.\n",
      "276: “Where does he live?”\n",
      "277: The cook turned away.\n",
      "278: “Little boys always know what they want to do,” he said.\n",
      "279: “He lives up at Hirsch’s rooming-house,” George said to Nick.\n",
      "280: “I’ll go up there.”\n",
      "281: Outside the arc-light shone through the bare branches of a tree.\n",
      "282: Nick walked up the street beside the car-tracks and turned at the next arc-light down a side-street.\n",
      "283: Three houses up the street was Hirsch’s rooming-house.\n",
      "284: Nick walked up the two steps and pushed the bell.\n",
      "285: A woman came to the door.\n",
      "286: “Is Ole Anderson here?”\n",
      "287: “Do you want to see him?”\n",
      "288: “Yes, if he’s in.”\n",
      "289: Nick followed the woman up a flight of stairs and back to the end of a corridor.\n",
      "290: She knocked on the door.\n",
      "291: “Who is it?”\n",
      "292: “It’s somebody to see you, Mr. Anderson,” the woman said.\n",
      "293: “It’s Nick Adams.”\n",
      "294: “Come in.”\n",
      "295: Nick opened the door and went into the room.\n",
      "296: Ole Anderson was lying on the bed with all his clothes on.\n",
      "297: He had been a heavyweight prizefighter and he was too long for the bed. He lay with his head on two pillows.\n",
      "298: He did not look at Nick.\n",
      "299: “What was it?” he asked.\n",
      "300: “I was up at Henry’s,” Nick said, “and two fellows came in and tied up me and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you.”\n",
      "301: It sounded silly when he said it.\n",
      "302: Ole Anderson said nothing.\n",
      "303: “They put us out in the kitchen,” Nick went on.\n",
      "304: “They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper.”\n",
      "305: Ole Anderson looked at the wall and did not say anything.\n",
      "306: “George thought I better come and tell you about it.”\n",
      "307: “There isn’t anything I can do about it,” Ole Anderson said.\n",
      "308: “I’ll tell you what they were like.”\n",

      "For each of the sentences in the following text, tag the sentences with tags indicating characters, places and speakers. When tagging sentences, follow these rules. 1. Add tags for characters and places even if they are not directly mentioned, but it is implied that they are related to the sentence. 2. If the sentence contains a line of dialogue, tag the persons who are being addressed by the speaker in addition to the speaker. 3. If the sentence refers to persons without naming them (for instance by using pronouns or descriptions, such as \"the man\"). look in the wider context of the text who is being referred to, and tag the sentence with their tag. The valid character tags are Max, Al, George, Nick, Sam, Ole, Mrs. Bell, and Motorman. The valid place tags are Lunchroom, Boarding house, and Lunchroom kitchen. The valid speaker tags are any character tag postfixed with \"line\", e.g. \"Max line\", \"Al line\" etc. Output exactly the same amount of lines as in the original text. Make sure to include all revelant tags for every sentence. Output sentences 1-50. Output the sentences and tags in JSON in the following format:{21: \"sentence\": \"“What’s yours?” George asked them.\", \"tags\": [\"George\",\"Al\",\"Max\",\"George line\",\"Lunchroom\"]}}\n",
